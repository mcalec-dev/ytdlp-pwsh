**How to Download**

Find the green `Code` button at the top of the repository. Open the drop-down menu and click `Download .zip`. Unzip the contents into a folder on your computer, and run the `run.ps1` file. If that doesnt work, try running the `yt-dlp.bat` file. (supported on all systems with command prompt)

If the files did not work in the GitHub `Download .zip`. Try this instead, find the releases section on the right. Click the latest release, and download the `ytdlp-pwsh.zip` file. Then, unzip into a folder on your computer.

Now you can download away! :3
